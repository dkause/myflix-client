# MyFlix-Client

*myFlix* is build in REACT and user Express to connect via an api to a no sql mongodatabase.
It uses node.js as a server - in short, it's based on the **MERN-STACK**.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to access information about movies so that I can learn more
about movies Iâ€™ve watched or am interested in.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.

## Features

The user can login and out, manipulate its data and delete its profile. Browse and filter movies and add them to his favorites list.

Works like a classic movie catalogue.

## Design Choices

Since this is a tech demo project and due to time constricts, I decided to use placeholder images, some real, some fake text as content. Maybe I will add reasonable content later, to provide an even better UserExperience. Furthermore I used Bootstrap for UI Elements, with some CSS modifications for a better look - mainly margins in the logo. Its all written in Visual Studio Code.

In general I like to ***KEEP THINGS SIMPLE STUPID***.

### User Experience

I put some focus on the profile form: it is prefilled with the user data. In further iterations I would like to make this more user friendly. By providing more context and validation of the user input.

## My Experience

This was a demanding tasks for me provided me some usefull insights into Frontend Development techniques. As coming from UX Design Background I got deeper understanding of team needs, as REACT's "fragmented" approach demands precise communication between components and people.
